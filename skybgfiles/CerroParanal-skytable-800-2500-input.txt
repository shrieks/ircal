   Components included in the radiance model:

      Scattered Moon Light:
         separation of Sun and Moon       :  90.00 degrees
         separation of Moon and object    :  45.00 degrees
         altitude of Moon above horizon   :  45.00 degrees
         distance to Moon                 :   1.0000

      Star Light

      Zodiacal Light:
         ecliptic longitude of object : 135.00 degrees
         ecliptic latiude of object   :  90.00 degrees

      Molecular Emission of Lower Atmosphere
      Emission Lines of Upper Atmosphere
      Airglow Continuum

   Wavelength grid:
       Range: 800.00 nm - 2500.00 nm
       Fixed wavelength step delta=0.10 nm

   LSF convolution kernel: none

The effective central wavelengths are respectively B=440nm, V=550nm, R=640nm, I=790nm, J=1250nm, H=1650nm, K=2200nm. The spectrum is scaled after integration over the corresponding photometric filter. The photometric zero points and effective wavelengths are taken from the two following references:

 
        (B,V,R,I) filters: Bessel, 1979, PASP, 91, 589
        (J,H,K)   filters: Bessel and Brett, 1998, PASP, 100, 1134

The sky magnitude is determined by the moon-phase and by the instrument bandpass, according to the table mentioned in the documentation. It should be noted that values for the Z band correspond to an extrapolation and assume a distribution of intensity constant with the wavelength. The sky spectrum in the 850-1100 nm and beyond present a number of atmospheric lines which are not modeled in the optical ETC.
