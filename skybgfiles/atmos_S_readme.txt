Below 2.3 microns, telluric features appear as absorption lines in the
spectra of astronomical objects. Above 2.3 microns, telluric features
appear as as both absorption lines and as sky emission lines. These
features can, with care, be used for wavelength calibration and they
are probably the most accurate way of calibrating M band and medium
resolution L band spectroscopic data.

A high resolution (R=40,000) spectrum of the Earth's telluric features
is provided as six indivdual spectra that cover the SZ (1.05 microns),
J, H, K, L and M atmospheric windows.

These spectra were created from data that was kindly made available by
the NSO/Kitt Peak Observatory. If you use this data, we would ask you
to add the following acknowledgement.  NSO/Kitt Peak FTS data used
here were produced by NSF/NOAO.
