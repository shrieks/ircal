    """
    Resamples a given sky spectrum from constant delta-lambda to constant R.
    Inputs:
          skymod - which sky model to use
                   cp = Gemini Cerro Pachon 10 mm H2O, airmass 1.0

    Output:
          resky  - resampled sky spectrum
                   2 column array. Column 1 is wavelength in nm
                                   Column 2 is flux in photons s-1 m-2 nm-1 arcsec-2
    
    Resampling is done by computing dlambda at the starting wavelength (lambda0) 
    and adding all photons between lambda0 and lambda0 + dlambda. Process repeats
    with lambda0 + dlambda as a starting point. Continues until the end point
    (currently 2500 nm)
