
Sky model:

My Mauna Kea model sky spectrum is from the Gemini SciOps data at airmiass 1.0,
1.6 mm water vapor.  Filter zero point information taken from the UKIRT web
pages, which are updated from Tokunaga & Vacca 2005.  Filter specs used to
calculate the zero points are from Tokunaga & Simon 2001.

   Flux(W m^-2 um^-1)   Jy   My_zp: photons s^-2 m^-2 in each bandpass
J    3.01e-9          1560   3.031e9

K    4.00e-10         645    1.5062e9

Using the sky model, filter zero points and filter specs, I calculate the Mauna
Kea sky brightness to be, in magnitudes ascsec^-2:

J 16.1
H 13.8
K' 14.8
Ks 14.8
K 14.9

These match the observed values reasonably well.

For Mt Hamilton, the Gemini dual camera IR instrument web pages quote the
following sky backgrounds, all in magnitude arcsec^-2:

J 16
H 14
K 13

The IRCAL manual quotes a K'-band sky brightness of 13 magnitudes
asec^-2, and says that the J and H backgrounds are 1-2 magnitudes
fainter.  I will use the values for J and H given for Mt. Hamiltion on
the Gemini web pages, as that instrument is used more frequently in J
and H. J=15, as could be inferred from the IRCAL pages, is much
brighter than any other J-band sky estimate.

My Mt. Hamilton sky background model is based on the Cerro Pachon sky spectrum
from the Gemini Obseratory SciOps data.  Cerra Pachon is at 9000' and the sky is
calculated for a temperature of 280K, more appropriate to Mt. Hamilton than the
Mauna Kea sky.  The sky model is for airmass 1.0, 10 mm precipable water vapor, 
as appropriate for Mt. Hamilton.

Using that model sky, I compute an sky brightness as follows,
in magnitude arcsec^2:

J 16.1
H 13.8
Ks 14.6
K' 14.6
K 14.4

This reproduces the J and H band sky brightness on Mt. Hamilton, but to get to
K=13 I have to add an additional thermal component to increase the sky
emissivity in K. The emissivity spectrum of this additional source is based on
the sky transmission model that goes with the Cerro Pachon sky model, calculated
using ATRAN. Emissivity is 1-transmission.  However, I need to impose on that
transmission spectrum a minimum emissivity of 0.5 at all wavelengths.  The
effect of the minimum is to increase the K-band emissivity and leave the J- and
H-band sky values unchanged.  Increasing the temperature of the sky spectrum
alone to reproduce K'=13 mag asec^-2, as given in the IRCAL manual, requires a
temperature of 313 K (40 C), which seems unreasonably high.  It is possible that
an ATRAN transmission spectrum calculated for the 4200 foot altitude of
Mt. Hamilton would reproduce the K-band sky brightness without the need for the
emissivity floor; I will pursue that in a later refinement of these
calculations.

My final, adjusted sky model predicts the Mt. Hamilton sky background to be:

J 16.1
H 13.8
Ks 12.9
Kp 13.1
K 12.3

Now for the AO system and instrument emissivities for the existing Shane AO and
IRCAL.  First I validate my model by reproducing the Keck AO system values, as
given in KAON501. The sky and emissivity model for the existing Keck AO system
used in KAON501 reproduce the measured background for the current Keck AO
system and NIRC2 instrument, and it is that calculation that I aim to match
in order to validate my model. 

The Keck total NIR background as measured with NIRC2 and quoted in NGAO doc
KAON501 is given below, in mag asec^-2.  The J-band discrapancy is noted in
KAON501 but not explained, and I will not attempt to explain it, either.

J 14.9
H 13.6
K 12.6

I follow KAON501 an model Keck with three aluminum surfaces at a temperature of
275.6 K. The rotator and AO system are all modeled at 278 K. Both temperatures
are the same as used in the KAON501 document. The rotator is three surfaces, two
silvered and one aluminum.  The AO system is modeled with four silvered
reflective surfaces, two surfaces and bulk emissivity for the dichroic, and one
surface plus bulk emissivity for the instrument window.  The bulk emissivities
are not an important contribution to the backgrounds. 

The silvered surfaces in the rotator and AO system are modeled with the
reflectivity curves of an enhanced silver coating by QCI (formerly Denton
Vacuum).  The transmission of the exit surface of the dichroic and the entrance
surface of the instrument window are modeled with the same coating for
convenience, as it is a reasonable proxy for a good but realistic near-IR
antireflection coating.  The front surface of the dichroic is modeled with the
measured Tip-Tilt dichroic reflectivity for the Shane AO upgrade. This is a
realistic, and is a reasonable match to the curve used in KAON501, which
was taken to be the one for the Palomar AO system.

The aluminum surfaces are modeled by adjusting the reflectivity of pristine
alumiunum down by 2.65% to reproduce some real-world data. Campbell et
al. (2003) measure the emissivity of Keck 1 to be 6.5% at 10 um.  The telescope
configuration for their measurement was a gold-coated secondary and a bare
alumium primary mirror.  They estimate 0.5% of the mirror area is in gaps
between segments. The emissivity of gold is less than 2% through the NIR.  Using
a value of 2% for the emissivity of gold and 1.0 for the emissivity of the
segment gaps, I can solve for the emissivity of alumimun that reproduces the
Cambell et al. (2003) measurement.  Doing that suggests that the average
reflectivty of the K1 primary aluminum is 96%, lower than the ideal value for
pristine aluminum.  Lowering the reflectivity of pristine aluminum by 2.65%
results in an average reflectivity of 95.5% at wavelengths 2 microns and redder.
The adjusted reflectivity aluminum curve in this region matches quite well the
reflectivity data for aluminum in the Gemini observatory mirror coating
development papers (**ref SPIE paper).  The KAON501 document uses a protected
aluminum coating that has significantly lower reflectivity, and therefore higher
emissivity, than pristine aluminum.  The adjusted aluminum reflectivty in my
model matches the final version of the aluminum coating in KAON501, including
the fudge factor of 0.8% used in KAON501. 

To reproduce the Keck AO and isntrument background data, I need to adjust the
surface emissivities. I assume that 5% of each surface (telescope, rotator and
AO system) is covered with dust or some other contaminating material with
emissiity of 0.5.  The effective emissivity of each surface is then the
area-weighted average of the emissivity of the surface coating and the dust.
For dust emissivity of 0.5 and 5% covering factor, the effective emissivity of
each surface increases by about 2%.  

Using the Manua Kea sky, the adjusted aluminum emissivity and the other coatings
as given above, and with the 5% dust contamination, I compute the following
backgrounds for the Keck AO system, in mag asec^-2:

J 16.1
H 13.8
K 12.2
Ks 12.7
Kp 13.0

If I use emissivity=1.0 for the dust, a covering factor of 2% gives th same
result.  The ~2% effective increase in the emissivity from the 5% dust
contamination is larger than the 0.8% increase KAON501 required to match the
background and data for the Keck system.  The discrepancy comes from how the
total system background is calculated in KAON501, which leads to about a factor
of 2 larger predicted flux for given surface emissivities vs. my calculations. I
am now sure that the calculations in KAON501 are incorrect.
