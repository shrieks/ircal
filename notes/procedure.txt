Example is J filter - 
start  lambda = 1170 nm
center lambda = 1250 nm
end    lambda = 1330 nm
zero point    = 3.031e9 ph s-1 m-2

For the sky:
-----------
Read in sky background in units photons s-1 m-2 nm-1 arcsec-2
compute dlambda (dlam) for sky background file

sky flux in J = dlam*Sum(sky flux between 1250 and 1330 nm)
              = 1128 ph s-1 m-2 arcsec-2

sky magnitude = -2.5*log10((sky flux in J)/(J zero point))
              = 16.073 mag arcsec-2

airy disk core radius in J filter = 3600*(180/pi)*1.22*(center lambda in m)/
     	       	      	   	    		       (telescope dia in m)
			          = 0.03 arcsecs for Keck

airy disk core angular area = pi*(core radius)^2 
     	       	            = 0.003 arcsec^2

Propagate sky flux in J through optics:
sky flux in airy core = dlam * Sum(sky flux output from telescope in J)
    	    	      	* (core area) * 0.86 * strehl
		      = 3.0 ph s-1 m-2

For the source:
--------------
Flux at top of atmosphere, F_lambda = 3.631e-9 erg s-1 cm-2 A-1
Convert units:                      = 3.631e-4 erg s-1 m-2 nm-1
hc in cgs                           = 1.9865e-16 erg cm

At each lambda, F at top of atmosphere = 3.631e-4 * (lambda in cm)/hc
                                 units = ph s-1 m-2 nm-1

Read in sky transmission file
Flux at telescope = (F at top of atmosphere) * (sky transmission)
            units = ph s-1 m-2 nm-1

Flux in J at primary = dlam * Sum(flux at telescope in J)
               units = 3.6e10 ph s-1 m-2

src magnitude at primary = -2.5*log10((src flux in J)/(J zero point))
                         = -2.68 mag

Propagate flux at telescope through optics:
source flux in airy core = dlam * Sum(src flux output from telescope in J)
       	       	    	   * 0.86 * strehl
                   units = ph s-1 m-2

src magnitude at output = -2.5*log10((src flux in airy core)/(J zero point))
                        = -2.68 mag

Signal to noise ratio = (source flux in airy core * area of telescope)/
       	                sqrt((src + sky in airy core) * area of telescope)
		      = (src in airy core)*sqrt(area)/(src + sky in airy core)
		      = huge!
