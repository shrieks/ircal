This BG is 12.6 mag asec^-2

I can also get a BG of 12.7 mag arcsec^-2 in K with 2% of the surface
covered by emissivity=1.0 dust

If I take out the extra "silver" surface that is standing in for the
bluk, I get a trivial change to the BG.  Fine, and no need to worry about
exactly what version of keckao2 is used. 

Without the 5% dust, but with the 2.65% redux for aluminum, still with
dust emissivity=0.5, BG is 13.1

Going to a 5% change in the aluminum from 2.65% (but without the dust
factor) gives K=12.9

Without either the dust or the change to al, BG is 13.44 

So the Al change is not the primary way to match the data.  Really
need the dust. 

If I go to emissivity=1.0 for the dust and still 5% of the surface
covered, BG is 12.2 mag asec^-2

But these numbers give too low throughput compared to KAON501.
To reproduce those throughputs, I need zero dust on the aluminum
surfaces, which makes sense since my 2.65% factor already matches
the KAON501 curves, and 0.8% on the rest of the surfaces, again matching
what KAON501 had to do.  So to match the KAON501 throughputs I have
to do what they did; not a big surprise.

Try this, which is 2.65%+0.8% adjusted to all the surfaces, as NGAO had to do:

tekeck = emissivity(lambda, keck, 2.6, delta=0.0345) 
tekao1 = emissivity(lambda, keckao1, 5., delta=0.0345)
tekao2 = emissivity(lambda, keckao2, 5., dustfac=0.008)
print, total(skyflux[kidx]+tekeck[kidx]+tekao1[kidx]+tekao2[kidx])*0.02
kflux =  total(skyflux[kidx]+tekeck[kidx]+tekao1[kidx]+tekao2[kidx])*0.02
print, -2.5*alog10(kflux/kzp)

13.0, so not quite.

oplot, palwave, palrefl-0.8, psym=0, color=clr.blue       

blue and green lines are really close, so the 2.65 is all I should need to match
teh Keck NGAO value of 13 mag arcsec^-2. If I have to add another 0.8%
to the 2.65%, that is significantly below the green line.  

But then we get to the fact that I think that KAON501 overestimates
the emissivity from the dust.

-----

The NGAO calculation just subtracts the dirt value, 0.8% in their case, from the
transmission for each surface, so it adds to the emissivity.  

Total emission at each surface i is calculated as the emissivity from
the previous surface times the transmission of surface i, plus the
emissivity of sufrace i: dat.emis[*,i] = dat.emis[*,i-1] * tran + emis
where the first index is over wavelength and the second over
surfaces. 

Total transmission at each surface i is the product of the transmission of
surface i and the transmission of the previous surfaces:
dat.otran[*,i] = dat.otran[*,i-1] * tran

dat.total_emis is the emissivity propogated through the last surface
(index value n_surface-1 in the above calculations),  plus any off-angle 
contribution (zero in this case). 

ftran is the filter transmission function, resampled to the same wavelength
values as everything else.

filt.fwhm is the FWHM of the filter. 

avg_tran is TOTAL(dat.otran[*,nopt-1] * dat.ftran)/TOTAL(dat.ftran)
so is the filter-weighted transmission at the last surface, which propogates 
all previous surfaces

The emissivity is then calculated as:

bkg_emis = dat.tot_emis * dat.ftran * dat.filt.fwhm/(TOTAL(dat.ftran * dat.dwvl) * avg_tran)
bkg_mag = -2.5 * ALOG10( TOTAL(bkg_emis * dat.dwvl) / filt[wf].pflx )

The bkg_mag can be done in two steps. The first computes teh flux over the
filter band:
bkd_flux = TOTAL(bkg_emis * dat.dwvl)
and the rest is to make magintudes from flux

So the flux calculation is:
TOTAL(dat.tot_emis * dat.ftran * dat.filt.fwhm * dat.dwvl/(TOTAL(dat.ftran * dat.dwvl) * avg_tran))

Which is:  TOTAL(dat.tot_emis * dat.ftran)*dat.dwvl*dat.filt.fwhm/(TOTAL(dat.ftran * dat.dwvl) * avg_tran)

The first part of the numerator is just emissivity at each wavelength times the filter transmission integrated over the filter bandpass.  It is equivalent to 
TOTAL(tot_emiss*ftran)*dlambda 

TOTAL(data.ftran)*dat.dwvl/FWHM can be approximated as
<ftran>*N*dat.dwvl/FWHM ~ <ftran> which is the average value of the filter
transmission function over the bandpass.

In that case, calculation for the background flux is:

TOTAL(dat.tot_emis * dat.ftran * dat.dwvl)/(<ftran> * avg_tran)

and the numerator is just the average total transmission, now accouting
for the filter transmission, too. 

And there are two questions to resolve: 1) should the demoninator have
that <ftran>*avg_tran term and 2) should the emissivity propagation include
the transmission of each surface?   I am almost positive that the
term in the denominator should NOT be there.  Looking at other
emissivity calculations, including Lloyd-Hart 2000, 2) doesn't belong
there, either.  Ah. Of course they should not be there.  These
are calibrated magnitudes, and the standard is observed through
the same system exactly to take out the throughput.  This is
just total flux.  If I want counts, then of course I need to include
2), but surely not 1).

If I take out both 1) and 2), then if I assume 2% of the surface
blocked by dust, the NGAO_BKG code calculates a K background of
12.65, pretty close to the right number and what my own code gets.

----------------------------

Now for the current Shane AO system:

shane = ['Aluminum', 'Aluminum']
oldao = ['oldao_1turn', 'oldao_tiptilt', 'oldao_oap1', 'oldao_dm', 'oldao_oap2', 'TT_Dichroic_Refl', 'X1_Silver_Extrap', 'X1_Silver_Extrap', 'X1_Silver_Extrap',  'X1_Silver_Extrap']

Eshane = emissivity(lambda, shane, 10., delta=0.0265, dustfac=0.02)
eshaneao = emissivity(lambda, oldao, 10., dustfac=0.02) 
print, total(skyflux[ksidx]+eshane[ksidx]+eshaneao[ksidx])*0.02
ksflux = total(skyflux[ksidx]+eshane[ksidx]+eshaneao[ksidx])*0.02
print, -2.5*alog10(ksflux/kszp)

Ks BG = 12.2 mag asec^-2

Reni tells me that the pupil image is 4.6 mm in diameter and the cold
stop is 5 mm.  That is equivalent to the cold stop letting in light
from a region 3.26 m in diameter.  The 3m primary takes up only 0.8464
of the area of that 3.26 m diameter region. 

I can treat that as a single area, with 84.6% having the emissivity of
an aluminized mirror and the rest having emissivity 1.0.  And I can
do that for all surfaces, because I think the oversize cold stop
lets in extra light from all surfaces.
Total dustfac = 1.-0.846 + 0.02 = 0.173

eshane = emissivity(lambda, shane, 10., delta=0.0265, dustfac=0.173)
eshaneao = emissivity(lambda, oldao, 10., dustfac=0.173) 
print, total(skyflux[ksidx]+eshane[ksidx]+eshaneao[ksidx])*0.02
ksflux = total(skyflux[ksidx]+eshane[ksidx]+eshaneao[ksidx])*0.02
print, -2.5*alog10(ksflux/kszp)

Ks BG calculated here is 11.3 mag asec^-2

To get to 10.3 I need another factor of 2.5 in BG

But that's not right.  The bigger pupil means that the effective size of the
radiating aperture is bigger than the one collecting data from the sky. So
I can't just use an effective emissivity as I did above. 

Area of the pupil at the scale of the primary: 8.35138 m^2
Area of the primary: 7.06858 m^2
So the radiating apertures are a factor of 8.35138/7.06858 = 1.181 larger.

Check: 1.181*0.846 = 0.999 ~ 1.0
Check: 1.181*(1.-0.846) = 0.182

So I think the emissivity calculation is:
eshane = emissivity(lambda, shane, 10., delta=0.0265, dustfac=0.02)
eshaneao = emissivity(lambda, oldao, 10., dustfac=0.02)
bgshane = 0.181*(emissivity(lambda, shane, 10., delta=0.0265, dustfac=1.0))
bgshaneao = 0.181*(emissivity(lambda, oldao, 10., dustfac=1.0))
print, total(skyflux[ksidx]+eshane[ksidx]+eshaneao[ksidx]+bgshane[ksidx]+bgshaneao[ksidx])*0.02

Ks BG = 11.14, so not much difference. Still need a factor of 2.2 in flux.

The following:

eshane = emissivity(lambda, shane, 10., delta=0.0265, dustfac=0.25) 
eshaneao = emissivity(lambda, oldao, 10., delta=0.05, dustfac=0.25)
 bgshane = 0.181*(emissivity(lambda, shane, 10., delta=0.0265, dustfac=1.0))
 bgshaneao = 0.181*(emissivity(lambda, oldao, 10., dustfac=1.0))
print, total(skyflux[ksidx]+eshane[ksidx]+eshaneao[ksidx]+bgshane[ksidx]+bgshaneao[ksidx])*0.02
ksflux = total(skyflux[ksidx]+eshane[ksidx]+eshaneao[ksidx]+bgshane[ksidx]+bgshaneao[ksidx])*0.02
print, -2.5*alog10(ksflux/kszp)

Gives a Ks background of 10.46 mag arcsec^-2.  

I may not have enough surfaces in oldao, say if there is an entrance window to
the AO system or a second dewar window for IRCAL.  More surfaces or a small
adjustment to the dust fraction would get to 10.3.  Adjusting the fractional
area leaking through the cold stop does surprisingly little.

I can split it between througput and dust:
eshane = emissivity(lambda, shane, 10., delta=0.1265, dustfac=0.15)  
eshaneao = emissivity(lambda, oldao, 10., delta=0.15, dustfac=0.15)
bgshane = 0.181*(emissivity(lambda, shane, 10., delta=0.0265, dustfac=1.0))
 bgshaneao = 0.181*(emissivity(lambda, oldao, 10., dustfac=1.0))

BG in Ks for this configuration is 10.476

If I re-do the shane AO calculations at 2.5C at the telescope and 5C for the AO
system, as for Keck, the BG gets fainter by about 0.4 mag, ~40%.  Not enough
to explain this.

Throughputs

These two the same as used above, note the last surface should probably be
CaF to match the exit surface as modeled in IRCAL.

shane = ['Aluminum', 'Aluminum']
oldao = ['oldao_1turn', 'oldao_tiptilt', 'oldao_oap1', 'oldao_dm', 'oldao_oap2', 'TT_Dichroic_Refl', 'X1_Silver_Extrap', 'X1_Silver_Extrap', 'X1_Silver_Extrap',  'X1_Silver_Extrap']


oldircal = ['CaF', 'X1_Silver_Extrap', 'X1_Silver_Extrap', 'X1_Silver_Extrap',  'X1_Silver_Extrap', 'PICNIC_QE']

newao = ['NaHG', 'NaHG', 'ALPAO', 'NaHG',  'TT_Dichroic_Refl', 'NaHG', 'MEMS_window', 'LGSWFS_Dich', 'FSG98', 'FSG98', 'CaF']

newircal = ['CaF', 'FSG98', 'FSG98', 'FSG98', 'FSG98', 'H2RG_QE']

Current AO system.  combined degradation in reflectivity/transmission is
0.1265+0.15=0.2765, 0.3 for the AO system. 

That's really brutal for the AO system, throughput is basically zero.
So go back to the Keck AO system degradations, 2% dustfac on everthing
and the 2.65% redux for aluminum.

thshane = throughput(lambda, shane, delta=0.0465) 
tholdao = throughput(lambda, oldao, delta=0.02)
tholdircal = throughput(lambda, oldircal)
thold = thshane*tholdao*tholdircal

At 2 um, throughput is about 2.6. At 1.5 um it is 0.22
The variation between 1 and 2 microns is driven by something 
in the old ircal coatings. 

thnewao = throughput(lambda, newao, delta=0.02)
thnewircal = throughput(lambda, newircal)
thnew = thshane*thnewao*thnewircal

average gain is 40% in throughput

For reasonable assumptions like those that reproduce the Keck NGAO
values, expect the current Shane AO system to have a background if
11.14 mag/asec^2 in Ks. 

If the cold stop were the right size, I would expect a BG of 12.2 mag/asec^2
in Ks, so we should get a mag fainter in BG just from fixing the cold stop.

For the new AO system, the background should be about the same, 12.2
mag/arcsec^2 in Ks.

There is an unaccounted for magnitude of BG, as the IRCAL BG is 10.3
mag/asec^2.  So we might do better, but since we don't know where that
is coming from we can't plan to fix it.

to worry too much about this discrepancy.
